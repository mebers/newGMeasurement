\maketitle

In 1899 Planck \cite{Planck1899}.
Let $m=\sqrt{hc/G}$.
$f \rightarrow G$, $b\rightarrow h$, $a\rightarrow h/k$
Comes to $55\rm\,\mu g$.

Not the first \cite{Tomilin1999} but most prescient.  SI
\cite{Jeckelmann_2018}.  Leaves out $G$.  Also candela, sievert.

Astros use Planckian units occasionally (with $\hbar$) but generally
not.  Stories of cross-sections in gallons/Mpc.\footnote{A gallon/Mpc
  is about a kilogram, but the exact value depends on which gallon.}
Why?

Solar mass in kg would be bad.  SI in astro has been a non-starter.
But spacecraft dynamics uses $GM$ in SI.

New SI new freedoms.  eV not a new unit.  Density as
$\!\unit{eV}\unit{m}^{-3}$ is fine.  Anarchy?  No, because conversions
only through physical constants.

For astros, don't need to express solar mass in kg.  But we'll get to
that.

First Light-second: au and pc.  Again, not a new unit.  Round like Pfund.

In the astronomy literature one finds many named units (\AA ngstr√∂m,
gauss, jansky) that are simply powers of 10 times SI units, which need
not detain us here.  There are also parody units such as
$\!\unit{gallon}\unit{Mpc}^{-1}$ for cross-sections (it depends on the
type of gallon, but is about a kilobarn), which would need an article
to themselves.  The only remaining unit that needs discussing is the
optical magnitude scale.  Optical magnitudes are a measure of
brightness going back to classical times, but like other units they
have been progressively redefined, and are now considered
SI-traceable.  A zero-magnitude source (such as the star Vega)
corresponds to a flux of roughly $10^{10}$ photons
$\!\unit{m}^{-2}\unit{s}$ in a typical spectral band.  More precisely,
zero magnitude is $5.480 \times10^{10}$ photons
$\!\unit{m}^{-2}\unit{s}$ per logarithmic spectral interval, with each
5~mag being 100 times fainter.  Since modern optical cameras are
invariably counters of photons, it makes sense to simply use photon
fluxes rather than optical magnitudes, with ``rounded'' magnitudes
used for historical comprehension.

Gravity-second $GM/c^3$ (pulsars).  Strange formulations.
Dimensionless velocity ok.  But density $\rho$ as $s^{-2}$ seems
strange.  But $(G\rho)^{-1/2}$ is a time scale.  And gravity-second
per second is a power.  Basically, avoid explicit $G$ in pure
gravitational phenomena.  Explicit $G$ only when gravity and non-grav
processes both appear.

In the 120 years since Planck speculated about it, we have yet to make
contact with non-human or extra-terrestrial cultures, and ask them if
they indeed share Planck's views on units.  What {\em has} happened,
however, is that physical constants have turned out to have meanings
not even Planck in 1899 had imagined.  As we all know, the following
year Planck himself discovered that $h$ (formerly known as $b$) was
about quantization.  A few years later the formal relation between
mass and energy through $c^2$ turned out to be real.  Starting in the
1920s $(\hbox{Planck mass})^{-2}\times(\hbox{proton mass})^3$ was
discovered to be the mass scale of stars.  Later in the 20th century,
$2e/h$ and $h/e^2$ turned out to be macroscopically observable as
Josephson's constant and von~Klitzing's constant.  And just in the
last few years, $c^5/G$ has been observed to be the power-output scale
for merging black holes.  We can only wonder what more surprises await
us.
